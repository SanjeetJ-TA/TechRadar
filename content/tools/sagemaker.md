# What is it ?
Amazon SageMaker provides machine learning (ML) capabilities for data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality ML models efficiently.

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to your data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms that are optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With native support for bring-your-own-algorithms and frameworks, SageMaker offers flexible distributed training options that adjust to your specific workflows. Deploy a model into a secure and scalable environment by launching it with a few clicks from SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker console. Training and hosting are billed by minutes of usage, with no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.

# Why ?
The Amazon SageMaker helps in the acceleration of Machine Learning development by reducing the training time from hours to minutes with further optimized infrastructure. It also helps in boosting the team productivity up to 10 times with the purpose-built tools.

# For who ?
* Projects and services that need to analyse data to predict outcomes.
* Data scientists that are looking to build predictive models as part of their work/service.
