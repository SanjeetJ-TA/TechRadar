                                The Radar sets out the current view of approved technologies and practices within Digital and those that are of interest for the future. <br />
                                It is a knowledge base about where we are today as a team and where we want to go.

                                    It provides an open, easily accessible view of accepted practice within Digital for projects to use. Providing guidance on what technologies can, should or should not be used - as well as where Digital are looking for opportunities to see if technologies fit our use case to improve how we build technology. <br />
                                    The original concept comes from thoughtworks, you can read more about it <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq">here</a>.
